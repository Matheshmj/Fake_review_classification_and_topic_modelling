# Fake_review_classification_and_topic_modelling

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake reviews and analyzing the underlying themes in the dataset through topic modeling. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, the project aims to classify reviews as genuine or fake while extracting prominent topics that provide deeper insights into the text.

## Key Features
The project incorporates two main functionalities. The first is fake review classification, where reviews are categorized into genuine or fake using traditional machine learning models and fine-tuned transformer models like DistilBERT. The second is topic modeling, which identifies recurring themes within the reviews using methods such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). These features enable a comprehensive understanding of the data and its inherent patterns

### Fake Review Classification
Classifies reviews as either genuine or fake using advanced machine learning and NLP techniques.

**Models used:**

1.Logistic Regression

2.Random Forest

3.DistilBERT (Fine-tuned Transformer Model)
